NAME
    Lingua::EN::Numbers::Easy -- Hash access to Lingua::EN::Numbers objects.

SYNOPSIS
        use Lingua::EN::Numbers::Easy;

        print "$N{1} fish, $N{2} fish, blue fish, red fish";
                             # one fish, two fish, blue fish, red fish.

DESCRIPTION
    "Lingua::EN::Numbers" is a module that translates numbers to English
    words. Unfortunally, it has an object oriented interface, which makes it
    hard to interpolate them in strings. "Lingua::EN::Numbers::Easy"
    translates numbers to words using a tied hash, which can be
    interpolated.

    By default, "Lingua::EN::Numbers::Easy" exports a hash %N to the
    importing package. This can be changed by giving "use
    Lingua::EN::Numbers::Easy" an argument - this argument is the name of
    the hash that will be used instead:

        use Lingua::EN::Numbers::Easy qw /%nums/;

    would use %nums as the tied hash.

    See also the "Lingua::EN::Numbers" man page.

    "Lingua::EN::Numbers::Easy" caches results - numbers will only be
    translated once.

    Any other operation on the exported hash than fetches will throw an
    exception.

  History
    This module was created at the end of the 20th century, when
    "Lingua::EN::Numbers" has a clunky, OO interface. Nowadays,
    "Lingua::EN::Numbers" has procedural interface as well, lessening the
    need for "Lingua::EN::Numbers::Easy".

    Furthermore, "Lingua::EN::Numbers" no longer supports different
    *British* and *American* modes. Therefore, the support for the modes has
    been dropped in "Lingua::EN::Numbers" as well.
